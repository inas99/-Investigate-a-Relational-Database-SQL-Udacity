## Investigate a Relational Database
I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions about the database.

The project end-result is a presentation of four slides. Each slide:

Has a question of interest.
Has a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
Has a supporting visualization created using the final data of my SQL query that answers my question of interest.
The four questions of interest are:

* What is the trend in the number of total rental orders till now for each category of family movies ? 
* For all rental orders till now, how the length of rental duration of specifically ‘Family’ category movies compares to the duration that all family movies are rented for?
* How can we compare the number of movies in each quartile for each category of family movies if we sort all movies according to the rental duration in ascending order of duration?
* Who were the top 10 paying customers and what was the amount of the monthly payments they made in 2007 ?
